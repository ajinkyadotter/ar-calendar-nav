# 🚀 DIRECT DEPLOYMENT - No GitHub Needed!

If GitHub isn't working, deploy directly from your computer:

## Method: Drag & Drop to Vercel

### Step 1: Prepare Your Folder
Your project is at: `C:\Users\ajdot\ar-calendar-nav`

**Make sure these files are there:**
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `next.config.ts`
- ✅ `app/` folder
- ✅ `tsconfig.json`

### Step 2: Deploy
1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/new**
2. Look for **"Browse"** or **"Upload"** button
3. OR just **drag the entire `ar-calendar-nav` folder** onto the page
4. Vercel will detect it's a Next.js project
5. Click **"Deploy"**

### Step 3: Wait
- Build takes 1-2 minutes
- Watch the progress

### Step 4: Get Link
